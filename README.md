# Overview
## Objectives
1. Demonstrate parameter estimation by optimization
2. Create and test hypotheses


## Skill Development
* **Data Science Principles:** statistical thinking
* **Coding:** hypothesis testing in python
* **Data Visualization:** displaying linear regression results
* **Professional:** continue to develop final project


# Deliverables
## 1. DataCamp Assignments
* Complete the assigned **DataCamp Modules** by logging in to *DataCamp > Organizations > My Assignments*:
    * [Statistical Thinking in Python 2](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-thinking-in-python-part-2)
        * Parameter estimation by optimization
        * Bootstrap confidence intervals
        * Introduction to hypothesis testing
        * Hypothesis test examples
        * Putting it all together: a case study


## 2. Case Study: 

* Pull and complete the [Case Study notebook](link.com) starter code & your assigned dataset from the [data folder](link.com) (both contained in this repository--see above) 
    * For each exercise in the case study, write and run the appropriate code to find the answer.
    * Save and commit your finished assignment back to the master branch. 

## 3. Prepare for Lab Session (Thurs.)
* Further develop final project analysis with emphasis on incorporating statistical thinking and improving data visualizations
